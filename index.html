        <p><code>fswatch</code> is a file change monitor that receives notifications when the contents
of the specified files or directories are modified.  <code>fswatch</code> implements four 
kinds of monitors:</p>

<ul>
<li>A monitor based on the <em>File System Events API</em> of Apple OS X.</li>
<li>A monitor based on <em>kqueue</em>, an event notification interface introduced in
FreeBSD 4.1 and supported on most *BSD systems (including OS X).</li>
<li>A monitor based on <em>inotify</em>, a Linux kernel subsystem that reports file
system changes to applications.</li>
<li>A monitor which periodically stats the file system, saves file modification
times in memory and manually calculates file system changes, which can work
on any operating system where <code>stat (2)</code> can be used.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>fswatch</code> should build and work correctly on any system shipping either of the
aforementioned APIs.</p>

<a id="getting-fswatch" class="anchor" href="#getting-fswatch" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting fswatch</h2>

<p>The recommended way to get the sources of <code>fswatch</code> in order to build it on
your system is getting a <a href="https://github.com/alandipert/fswatch/releases">release tarball</a>.  A release tarball
contains everything a user needs to build <code>fswatch</code> on his system, following
the instructions detailed in the Installation section below and the INSTALL
file.</p>

<p>Getting a copy of the source repository is not recommended, unless you are a
developer, you have the GNU Build System installed on your machine and you know
how to bootstrap it on the sources.</p>

<h2>
<a id="getting-fswatch-1" class="anchor" href="#getting-fswatch-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting fswatch</h2>

<p>A regular user may be able to fetch <code>fswatch</code> from the package manager of your
OS or a third-party one.  If you are looking for <code>fswatch</code> for OS X, you can
install it using either <a href="https://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a> or <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>:</p>

<pre><code># MacPorts
$ port install fswatch

# Homebrew
$ brew install fswatch
</code></pre>

<p>Check your favourite package manager and let us know if <code>fswatch</code> is missing
there.</p>

<p>A user who whishes to build <code>fswatch</code> should get a <a href="https://github.com/alandipert/fswatch/releases">release tarball</a>.
A release tarball contains everything a user needs to build <code>fswatch</code> on his
system, following the instructions detailed in the Installation section below
and the <code>INSTALL</code> file.</p>

<p>A developer who wishes to modify <code>fswatch</code> should get the sources (either from a
source tarball or cloning the repository) and have the GNU Build System
installed on his machine.  Please read <code>README.gnu-build-system</code> to get further
details about how to bootstrap <code>fswatch</code> from sources on your machine.</p>

<p>Getting a copy of the source repository is not recommended unless you are a
developer, you have the GNU Build System installed on your machine, and you know
how to bootstrap it on the sources.</p>

<h2>
<a id="documentation" class="anchor" href="#documentation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Documentation</h2>

<p><code>fswatch</code> provides the following documentation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Texinfo documentation, included with the distribution.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://emcrisostomo.github.io/fswatch/doc/html">HTML</a> documentation.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch/wiki">wiki</a> page.</li>
<li>A man page.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>fswatch</code> official documentation is provided in Texinfo format.  This is the
most comprehensive source of information about <code>fswatch</code>.  The man page, in
particular, is a stub meant for quick reference from the command line and is not
guaranteed to be kept up to date.</p>

<p>By default, only Info and DVI formats are generated when <code>fswatch</code> is built,
according to the default rules of the GNU Build Systems.  However, a PDF manual
typeset with TeX can be generated from the Texinfo sources by issuing this
command:</p>

<pre><code>$ make pdf
</code></pre>

<p>and can then be installed invoking the <code>install-pdf</code> target:</p>

<pre><code>$ make install-pdf
</code></pre>

<p>Since typical users will not have a TeX distribution installed in their
computers, the PDF manuals for every version of <code>fswatch</code> will be hosted at
<a href="http://emcrisostomo.github.io/fswatch/doc/pdf">this address</a>.</p>

<p>If you are installing <code>fswatch</code> using a package manager and you would like the
PDF manual to be bundled into the package, please send a feature request to the
package maintainer.</p>

<h2>
<a id="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p><code>fswatch</code> accepts a list of paths for which change events should be received:</p>

<pre><code>$ fswatch [options] ... path-0 ... path-n
</code></pre>

<p>The event stream is created even if any of the paths do not exist yet.  If they
are created after <code>fswatch</code> is launched, change events will be properly
received.  Depending on the watcher being used, newly created paths will be
monitored after the amount of configured latency has elapsed.</p>

<p>The output of <code>fswatch</code> can be piped to other program in order to process it
further:</p>

<pre><code>$ fswatch -0 path | while read -d "" event \
  do \
    // do something with ${event}
  done
</code></pre>

<p>To run a command when a set of change events is printed to standard output but
no event details are required, then the following command can be used:</p>

<pre><code>$ fswatch -o path | xargs -n1 -I{} program
</code></pre>

<p>The behaviour is consistent with earlier versions of <code>fswatch</code> (v. 0.x).
Please, read the <em>Compatibility Issues with fswatch v. 0.x</em> section for further
information.</p>

<p>By default <code>fswatch</code> chooses the best monitor available on the current platform,
in terms of performance and resource consumption.  If the user wishes to specify
a different monitor, the <code>-m</code> option can be used to specify the monitor by name:</p>

<pre><code>$ fswatch -m kqueue_monitor path
</code></pre>

<p>The list of available monitors can be obtained with the <code>-h</code> option.</p>

<p>For more information, refer to the <code>fswatch</code> documentation.</p>
