        <p><code>fswatch</code> is a file change monitor that receives notifications when the contents
of the specified files or directories are modified.  <code>fswatch</code> implements four 
kinds of monitors:</p>

<ul>
<li>A monitor based on the <em>File System Events API</em> of Apple OS X.</li>
<li>A monitor based on <em>kqueue</em>, an event notification interface introduced in
FreeBSD 4.1 and supported on most *BSD systems (including OS X).</li>
<li>A monitor based on <em>inotify</em>, a Linux kernel subsystem that reports file
system changes to applications.</li>
<li>A monitor which periodically stats the file system, saves file modification
times in memory and manually calculates file system changes, which can work
on any operating system where <code>stat (2)</code> can be used.</li>
</ul><p><code>fswatch</code> should build and work correctly on any system shipping either of the
aforementioned APIs.</p>

<a name="getting-fswatch" class="anchor" href="#getting-fswatch"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting fswatch</h2>

<p>The recommended way to get the sources of <code>fswatch</code> in order to build it on
your system is getting a <a href="https://github.com/alandipert/fswatch/releases">release tarball</a>.  A release tarball
contains everything a user needs to build <code>fswatch</code> on his system, following
the instructions detailed in the Installation section below and the INSTALL
file.</p>

<p>Getting a copy of the source repository is not recommended, unless you are a
developer, you have the GNU Build System installed on your machine and you know
how to bootstrap it on the sources.</p>

<h2>
<a name="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<p>See the <code>INSTALL</code> file for detailed information about how to configure and
install <code>fswatch</code>.</p>

<p><code>fswatch</code> is a C++ program and a C++ compiler compliant with the C++11 standard
is required to compile it.  Check your OS documentation for information about
how to install the C++ toolchain and the C++ runtime.</p>

<p>No other software packages or dependencies are required to configure and
install <code>fswatch</code> but the aforementioned APIs used by the file system monitors.</p>

<h2>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p><code>fswatch</code> accepts a list of paths for which change events should be received:</p>

<pre><code>$ fswatch [options] ... path-0 ... path-n
</code></pre>

<p>The event stream is created even if any of the paths do not exist yet.  If they
are created after <code>fswatch</code> is launched, change events will be properly
received.  Depending on the watcher being used, newly created paths will be
monitored after the amount of configured latency has elapsed.</p>

<p>The output of <code>fswatch</code> can be piped to other program in order to process it
further:</p>

<pre><code>$ fswatch -0 path | while read -d "" event \
  do \
    // do something with ${event}
  done
</code></pre>

<p>To run a command when a set of change events is printed to standard output but
no event details are required, then the following command can be used:</p>

<pre><code>$ fswatch -o path | xargs -n1 -I{} program
</code></pre>

<p>The behaviour is consistent with earlier versions of <code>fswatch</code> (v. 0.x).
Please, read the <em>Compatibility Issues with fswatch v. 0.x</em> section for further
information.</p>

<p>For more information, refer to the <code>fswatch</code> man page.</p>
