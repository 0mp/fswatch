{"name":"fswatch","tagline":"A cross-platform file change monitor with multiple backends: Apple OS X File System Events API, *BSD kqueue, Linux inotify and a stat-based backend.","body":"`fswatch` is a file change monitor that receives notifications when the contents\r\nof the specified files or directories are modified.  `fswatch` implements four \r\nkinds of monitors:\r\n\r\n  * A monitor based on the _File System Events API_ of Apple OS X.\r\n  * A monitor based on _kqueue_, an event notification interface introduced in\r\n    FreeBSD 4.1 and supported on most *BSD systems (including OS X).\r\n  * A monitor based on _inotify_, a Linux kernel subsystem that reports file\r\n    system changes to applications.\r\n  * A monitor which periodically stats the file system, saves file modification\r\n    times in memory and manually calculates file system changes, which can work\r\n    on any operating system where `stat (2)` can be used.\r\n\r\n`fswatch` should build and work correctly on any system shipping either of the\r\naforementioned APIs.\r\n\r\nGetting fswatch\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe recommended way to get the sources of `fswatch` in order to build it on\r\nyour system is getting a [release tarball][release].  A release tarball\r\ncontains everything a user needs to build `fswatch` on his system, following\r\nthe instructions detailed in the Installation section below and the INSTALL\r\nfile.\r\n\r\nGetting a copy of the source repository is not recommended, unless you are a\r\ndeveloper, you have the GNU Build System installed on your machine and you know\r\nhow to bootstrap it on the sources.\r\n\r\n[release]: https://github.com/alandipert/fswatch/releases\r\n\r\nGetting fswatch\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nA regular user may be able to fetch `fswatch` from the package manager of your\r\nOS or a third-party one.  If you are looking for `fswatch` for OS X, you can\r\ninstall it using either [MacPorts] or [Homebrew]:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# MacPorts\r\n$ port install fswatch\r\n\r\n# Homebrew\r\n$ brew install fswatch\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck your favourite package manager and let us know if `fswatch` is missing\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nA user who whishes to build `fswatch` should get a [release tarball][release].\r\nA release tarball contains everything a user needs to build `fswatch` on his\r\nsystem, following the instructions detailed in the Installation section below\r\nand the `INSTALL` file.\r\n\r\nA developer who wishes to modify `fswatch` should get the sources (either from a\r\nsource tarball or cloning the repository) and have the GNU Build System\r\ninstalled on his machine.  Please read `README.gnu-build-system` to get further\r\ndetails about how to bootstrap `fswatch` from sources on your machine.\r\n\r\nGetting a copy of the source repository is not recommended unless you are a\r\ndeveloper, you have the GNU Build System installed on your machine, and you know\r\nhow to bootstrap it on the sources.\r\n\r\n[MacPorts]: https://www.macports.org\r\n[Homebrew]: http://brew.sh\r\n[release]: https://github.com/alandipert/fswatch/releases\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n`fswatch` provides the following [documentation]:\r\n\r\n  * Texinfo documentation, included with the distribution.\r\n  * HTML documentation.\r\n  * PDF documentation.\r\n  * A [wiki] page.\r\n  * A man page.\r\n\r\n`fswatch` official documentation is provided in Texinfo format.  This is the\r\nmost comprehensive source of information about `fswatch`.  The man page, in\r\nparticular, is a stub meant for quick reference from the command line and is not\r\nguaranteed to be kept up to date.\r\n\r\nBy default, only Info and DVI formats are generated when `fswatch` is built,\r\naccording to the default rules of the GNU Build Systems.  However, a PDF manual\r\ntypeset with TeX can be generated from the Texinfo sources by issuing this\r\ncommand:\r\n\r\n    $ make pdf\r\n\r\nand can then be installed invoking the `install-pdf` target:\r\n\r\n    $ make install-pdf\r\n\r\nSince typical users will not have a TeX distribution installed in their\r\ncomputers, the PDF manuals for every version of `fswatch` will be hosted at\r\n[this address][documentation].\r\n\r\nIf you are installing `fswatch` using a package manager and you would like the\r\nPDF manual to be bundled into the package, please send a feature request to the\r\npackage maintainer.\r\n\r\n[documentation]: http://emcrisostomo.github.io/fswatch/doc\r\n[wiki]: https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch/wiki\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n`fswatch` accepts a list of paths for which change events should be received:\r\n\r\n    $ fswatch [options] ... path-0 ... path-n\r\n\r\nThe event stream is created even if any of the paths do not exist yet.  If they\r\nare created after `fswatch` is launched, change events will be properly\r\nreceived.  Depending on the watcher being used, newly created paths will be\r\nmonitored after the amount of configured latency has elapsed.\r\n\r\nThe output of `fswatch` can be piped to other program in order to process it\r\nfurther:\r\n\r\n    $ fswatch -0 path | while read -d \"\" event \\\r\n      do \\\r\n        // do something with ${event}\r\n      done\r\n\r\nTo run a command when a set of change events is printed to standard output but\r\nno event details are required, then the following command can be used:\r\n\r\n    $ fswatch -o path | xargs -n1 -I{} program\r\n\r\nThe behaviour is consistent with earlier versions of `fswatch` (v. 0.x).\r\nPlease, read the _Compatibility Issues with fswatch v. 0.x_ section for further\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nBy default `fswatch` chooses the best monitor available on the current platform,\r\nin terms of performance and resource consumption.  If the user wishes to specify\r\na different monitor, the `-m` option can be used to specify the monitor by name:\r\n\r\n    $ fswatch -m kqueue_monitor path\r\n\r\nThe list of available monitors can be obtained with the `-h` option.\r\n\r\nFor more information, refer to the `fswatch` documentation.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2013-2015 Enrico M.
