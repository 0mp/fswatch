{"name":"fswatch","tagline":"A cross-platform file change monitor with multiple backends: Apple OS X File System Events API, *BSD kqueue, Linux inotify and a stat-based backend.","body":"`fswatch` is a file change monitor that receives notifications when the contents\r\nof the specified files or directories are modified.  `fswatch` implements four \r\nkinds of monitors:\r\n\r\n  * A monitor based on the _File System Events API_ of Apple OS X.\r\n  * A monitor based on _kqueue_, an event notification interface introduced in\r\n    FreeBSD 4.1 and supported on most *BSD systems (including OS X).\r\n  * A monitor based on _inotify_, a Linux kernel subsystem that reports file\r\n    system changes to applications.\r\n  * A monitor which periodically stats the file system, saves file modification\r\n    times in memory and manually calculates file system changes, which can work\r\n    on any operating system where `stat (2)` can be used.\r\n\r\n`fswatch` should build and work correctly on any system shipping either of the\r\naforementioned APIs.\r\n\r\nTable of Contents\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n[Getting fswatch][getting]\r\n[Documentation]\r\n[Usage]\r\n\r\n[getting]: getting.html\r\n[Documentation]: documentation.html\r\n[Usage]: usage.html\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2013-2015 Enrico M.
